#wishlist:

#weird traits like big ears, and more of them.

#more description: hair color, eye color, height, build,

#inbreeding counter

#more quirks; better tutoring system

#longevity counter which determines when the person is going to die

#script that increments the age of the children and kills them as they pass their death-date
